When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share code between other developers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If we are in middle of modifying code and git will change code or state of code will becomes inconsistent

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are github specific, basically cloning within github servers
Clones means making a copy from repository to local
Branch is creating parallel code
